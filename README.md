### Funding Allocation Overview

Enterprise Community Partners strategically allocates funds to address multiple facets of housing and community needs, ensuring that resources go beyond just creating housing units. This holistic approach includes investments in areas like health, resilience, and economic mobility, as illustrated in the image below. These focus areas collectively support the upward mobility of individuals and communities, targeting the root causes of housing instability and promoting long-term security and prosperity.

1. **Housing Stability**: Funding is directed toward projects that help residents avoid unwanted moves and disruptions, contributing to a stable living environment that allows individuals and families to thrive without the stress of constant relocation.

2. **Housing Quality**: Enterprise invests in housing projects that emphasize quality, ensuring that residences are not only affordable but also safe, sanitary, and conducive to physical and mental well-being. This focus promotes better health outcomes and higher quality of life for residents.

3. **Housing Affordability**: Affordability remains a cornerstone of Enterprise’s funding strategy. Projects are selected based on their ability to provide housing that is financially accessible, reducing the burden on low-income households and preventing homelessness.

4. **Neighborhood Context**: Enterprise also considers the broader community in which housing projects are developed. Investments are made to enhance neighborhood amenities, accessibility, and safety, giving residents an environment that supports their ability to thrive and grow.

5. **Housing that Builds Assets and Wealth**: By creating pathways to homeownership and financial literacy, Enterprise empowers residents to build assets and accumulate wealth, contributing to their long-term economic security.
